# Minesweeper by Sang Ok Suh

## Overview  
I have recreated the famous Minesweeper game with two difficuties:  
1. Easy (9x9 with 10 bombs)

2. Hard (16x16 with 40 Bombs)

## Contents  
I have provided one file and one image folder:  

1. minesweeper.py  
2. images  

Both files have to be in the same folder to run the pygame successfully.  

## Program Instructions  
To run the game in the terminal, you need to install **pygame** if you don't have it installed.  

**From the pygame.org website:**    
The best way to install pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages).   
Note, this comes with python in recent versions.   
We use the --user flag to tell it to install into the home directory, rather than globally.  

	python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user  
	

After intalling pygame, you can open the game in the terminal using the following scripts (depends on your python):
	py minesweeper.py
	python3 minesweeper.py
